  <p class="para1"><i>
      This is the complete source code for <u>Quake 2</u>,
      Version <sup>3.19</sup>, buildable with <u>Visual C++</u> <sub>6.0</sub>. The
      <u>Linux</u> Version should be buildable, but we haven't
      tested it for release.
    </i></p>
  <p>
    The code is all licensed under the term <mark><u>GPL (gnu
        public license)</u></mark>. You should read the entire
    license, but the gist of it is that you can do
    anything you want with the code, including sale
    your new version. The catch is that if you
    distribute the <mark>new binary versions</mark>, you are
    required to make the entire source code available
    for free to every one.
  </p>
  <center>
    <p>
      The primary intent of this release is for
      <mark>entertainment & educational purpose</mark> but the <mark>GPL</mark>
      does allows <mark>commercial exploitation</mark> or if you obey
      thee full license. If you want to do something
      commercial & you just cant bare to have your source
      changes release, we could still <mark>negotiate a
        separate license agreement (for $$$)</mark>, but I would
      encourage you to just live with the <mark><del>GPL</del> <ins>GNU Public License</ins></mark>.
